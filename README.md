## Problem Description

As of Summer 2022, the rising price of gasoline has become a pressing issue for many Americans. Prices have shown an upward trend, and there is significant interest in understanding if this trend will continue in the short term. The objective of this project is to predict the near-term price of gasolineâ€”ideally as soon as the upcoming week. Accurate predictions could assist citizens in budgeting for gasoline usage and help policymakers in addressing rising costs more effectively.
